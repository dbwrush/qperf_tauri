# qperformance

**qperformance** is an app to quickly calculate the performance of Bible Quizzers on all question types across multiple rounds. It processes `.csv` logs generated by QuizMachine along with corresponding `.rtf` question sets, providing a detailed performance analysis of individual quizzers.

**Looking for the command-line version?** Check out [qperf_cli](https://github.com/dbwrush/qperf_cli) for all the same functionality in a command-line interface.

## Getting Started

### Downloading Pre-Compiled Builds (Recommended for most users)

Compiled binaries of **qperformance** are available for:

- **Windows PCs** (x86, Intel/AMD CPUs)
- **Linux PCs** (x86, Intel/AMD CPUs)

Visit the [Releases](https://github.com/dbwrush/qperformance/releases) page to download the latest version.

> **Note:**  
> The vast majority of Windows PCs use Intel or AMD CPUs compatible with this program. If you're unsure, try running the Windows build first.

For other systems (e.g., macOS or ARM-based devices), you will need to build the program from source. 

**Command-line**: This version uses a graphical interface that is easier for most users. If you prefer a command-line interface, check out [qperf_cli](https://github.com/dbwrush/qperf_cli)

### Building From Source (For Developers)
If the pre-compiled versions don't work on your machine or you're using a platform like macOS or ARM-based devices, you can build `qperf_tauri` from source.

**Prerequisites**

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) must be installed on your system.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version) and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) must also be installed.

**Build Instructions**

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dbwrush/qperf_tauri.git
   cd qperf_tauri
   ```

2. **Install frontend dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Build the project**:
   ```bash
   cargo tauri dev
   ```

4. **Run the executable** from the `target/release` directory:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/qperf_tauri
   ```
